Author: Juliette Taylor and Roujia Lin

Goal: The goal of this project is to discuss the neural network model. To achieve that goal, we first show a simple neural network model, and then we train a more complec one. By setting up these models, we introduce the drawbacks, the advantages and the application of the Neural Network model.

Motivation: The reason of creating this project is to learn more about how supervised model work and be used in the area of public policy.

Status: This project is completed.
